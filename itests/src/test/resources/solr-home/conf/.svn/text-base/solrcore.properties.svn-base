# to make the solrconfig generic, and sharable between different solr indexes
# you should define the property solr.solr.home on the line below, with the 
# value set to the full path of the solr home directory.

#solr.solr.home=/usr/local/projects/debugging/solr
#solr.solr.home=/lib_content27/solr/indexing

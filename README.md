Beverly is a tool for event-driven indexing of Fedora Commons digital object repositories. While it is intended mainly for use with Apache Solr, with a little tinkering it could be used with any indexing application that accepts XML records at an update Web service. Please see <http://uvalib.github.com/beverly> for more information.

            <p>
                Tika is brought into play when a datastream is determined to have a MIME-type other than those
                recorded in the configuration setting "xmlTypes". This is based entirely on Fedora's determination, so 
                it is necessary to record accurate MIME-types for datastreams in the repositories.
            </p>

        <section name="What does Tika do?">
            <p><a href="https://tika.apache.org">Apache Tika</a> is used to extract metadata from
            non-XML datastreams. When such are presented to Beverly (by being referenced in RELS-INT
            of an indexable object) they are first presented to Tika and what metadata Tika can
            extract are serialized in XML form. Each field is put into an XML element of that
            name and all of them are wrapped in a "Metadata" element. For example:
                <source>
                    &lt;Metadata&gt;
                        &lt;Content-Type&gt;image/jpeg&lt;/Content-Type&gt;
                    &lt;Metadata/&gt;
                </source>
                XSLT can then act on this result in the same way as on XML metadata.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="What will Tika give you?">
            <p>That's up to Tika. Tika will extract what it can from any bitstream with which it is presented
            with no more clue than the MIME-type that Fedora provides. For more information on what Tika can do, 
                <a href="https://tika.apache.org/1.1/formats.html">check it out</a>.</p>

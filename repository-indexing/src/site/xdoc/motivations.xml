            <p>The University of Virginia Library, like many institutions, faced pair of interrelated problems. Firstly, the indexing of content
            in our digital object repositories was accomplished by piecework scripts written by technicians whose expertise does not extend to
            curating the materials in our collections. Secondly, our presentation of those materials was and is increasingly dependent on index
            records.</p>

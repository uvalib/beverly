            <p>The University of Virginia Library, like many institutions, faced a pair of interrelated problems. Firstly, the indexing of content
            in our digital object repositories was accomplished by piecework batch-processing scripts written by technicians whose expertise does not extend to
            curating the materials in our collections. Secondly, our presentation of those materials was and is increasingly dependent on index
            records.</p>
            <p>In order to attack both of these problems, we decided to construct an indexing system that maintains workflow configuration in the repositories
            themselves (whcih will eventually allow for it to be altered via user-friendly tools acting on the repositories) and does indexing in an event-driven manner that is triggered
            by changed in the repository state. This allows for curatorial personel to make changes to the repository contents and have those changes
            propagate into the indexes that support presentation <i>without</i> intervention from technicians. Because we maintain the indexing configurations
            in the repositories where we can rely on Fedora's notification system, we can also be sure that when the indexing transforms
            change, the results propagate across all the affected objects and index records automatically.</p>

            <p>Beverly is an indexing system for <a href="http://fedora-commons.org/">Fedora</a> digital object repositories and <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> indexes.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Features">
            <p>Beverly can index multiple repositories, using distinct indexing confgurations for distinct collections or even
                (in the extreme case) a separate indexing configuration for each and every object therein.
                It has highly-parallelized internal workflows and takes advantage of message queuing to offer good
                scaling characteristics. An index record can be composed of information from one or more datastreams,
                or even datastreams multiple objects (for example, from a collection-level object and an item-level
                object.)</p>
          
        </section>
        <section name="Properties">
            <p>      Beverly relies on Fedora's ability to <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35/Messaging">publish events</a>
                about changes to repository contents.
                The configuration for indexing workflows is held in the repositories right next to the objects being indexed, in Fedora's internal RDF graph. Currently, Beverly is limited
            to indexing XML metadata, but that will hopefully not be the case for much longer. Indexing transformations are written in XSLT. </p>

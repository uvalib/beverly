            <p>Beverly works between one or more Fedora repositories and an Apache Solr index.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="What you will have to supply">
            <p>Currently, the only way to use Beverly is by housing in in <a href="https://karaf.apache.org/">Apache Karaf</a>, 
                a powerful and full-featured OSGi container.
            Installing and running Karaf is outside the scope of this document, but excellent instructions
            are available <a href="https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest-2.2.x/quick-start.html">here</a> and the
            community is friendly!</p>
            <p>Because Karaf allows of reusing the transitive dependency management power of Maven, but the Maven repository into
            which Beverly is developed is not public, you will want to have a running Maven repository available to you into which you can install
            the Beverly code, from which it will be deployed to your Karaf instance.</p>
